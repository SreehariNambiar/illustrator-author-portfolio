    <div className='hhhh'>
        I am a software develper for a prominent IT firm at the moment. But I am passionate about front end web designing, illustrating, character designing and gaming.

        Aidokano, is my persona for my creative freedom. Although I don't do this full time, I write novel, draw illustrations when I have mood.  Hope you find it fun as well. I will share more updates soon.

        I like anime, reading manga, and also art in general. The likeness to manga and anime got me to start this as a hobby.

        Although, I wont say I am very good at this craft atleast I enjoy doing it. For me that's more important. I am passionate about creating stuff in general. So coding is also one of my passion.
